# Webtoon Crawler
*The crawler that downloads Naver, Daum, and NateOn webtoons.*

## Overview
Webtoon Crawler is a GUI-based program currently only supports downloading from Naver.

My goal is to support webtoon downloading from Daum and NateOn also.

Note that I ***didn't / couldn't receive permission for this program from any of the three vendors
since none of them provided Webtoon API***.

The program looks as below.
